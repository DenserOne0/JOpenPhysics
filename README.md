# JOpenPhysics
A purely Java based Physics Engine. Designed to be functional, versatile, and open source.

Built on top of pure Java code, JOpenPhysics is a physics engine designed to run on it's own thread, and be easy to read, understand, and use for the the common Java programmer.

JOpenPhysics was concieved when I felt that there were no easy to use, open source, and intuitive physics libraries for Java. So, like any normal human being, I decided to make what I didn't have.
